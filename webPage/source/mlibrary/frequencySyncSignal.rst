Frequency Synchronization Signal
################################


In many experiments a beam is accelerated and used to produce physics reactions.

The accelerator provide timing signature of the beam, in the form of radio-frequency RF.

The beam is grouped in bunches, distant :math:`\delta t = 1/RF` from each other.

The radio-frequancy signature is recorded typically every :math:`N_{RF}` bunches.

Sync signal
-----------

A sync signal is generated a random number N of bunches away from the event start time.
The signal is repeated forward and backward in time, every :math:`N_{RF}\delta t` seconds, until the
event electronic time window is filled.

The situation is explained in the figure below.

An arbitrary number of sync signal can be generated by givin their time distance away from each other.

Sync signal control
-------------------

The option **RFSETUP** is used to control the sync signal.
For example, to set the accelerator radio frequency to 500MHz (0.5 GHz) and produce two RF signal,
30 ns away from each other, each every 80ns::

  -RFSETUP="0.5, 80, 30"
