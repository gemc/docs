Paddles Example
===============

This example shows how to build a Time Of Flight Scintillator array around the beam with few lines a code.
The scintillators are trapezoids.
The base closest to the beam is smaller than the one further away to ensure full azimuthal coverage.

Notice how users can focus on the geometry dimensions and positions and do not need to know c++ or geant4.

Requirements
------------

- gemc 2.4 or newer
