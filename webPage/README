README
------

When starting sphinx from scratch the command:

sphinx-quickstart

will create a directory with the configuration file.
I used "separate source and build" to have a nice separation.
Also:

> imgmath: include math, rendered as PNG or SVG images (y/n) [n]: y
> mathjax: include math, rendered in the browser by MathJax (y/n) [n]: y


All this can be changed in the file conf.py


## Fix sphinx build errors:

cd docs                    # or your project root
python3 -m venv .venv   # or python3.12 if you want fewer surprises
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -U pip setuptools
pip install sphinx sphinxcontrib-images
sphinx-build -b html source build

Sphinx version
--------------

Careful the very latest versions of sphinx (installed with pip3) may not work.
To install a previous version:

 sudo  pip3 install "sphinx<6"



Themes
------

Some themes here: https://sphinx-themes.org
Get the theme from the "download" section (usually inside pyPy)
locate the relevant files that have "layout.html", theme.conf and static.
For crate: src/crate/theme/rtd/crate/*
Copy them in a directory created  source/_themes/mauri

html_theme = 'mauri'
html_theme_path = ['_themes']





GEMC Website
------------

Local server is in

/group/clas/www/gemc/html




To not include a doc in the tocree, add

:orphan:

at its top.




To document:

geantino and record_passby


TODO:
