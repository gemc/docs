README
------

When starting sphinx from scratch the command:

sphinx-quickstart

will create a directory with the configuration file.
I used "separate source and build" to have a nice separation.

All this can be changed in the file conf.py

Packages to be installed:

pip install sphinxcontrib-images


Sphinx version
--------------

Careful the very latest versions of sphinx (installed from github or pip) may not work.
To install a previous version:
1. get the releases: https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/releases
2. untar, and type sudo pip install .




GEMC Website
------------

Local server is in

/group/clas/www/gemc/html




To not include a doc in the tocree, add

:orphan:

at its top.




To document:

geantino and record_passby


TODO:

Make search part of headbar? Remove sidebar, it will look cleaner.
